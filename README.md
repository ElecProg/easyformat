easyformat
==========

is a package that allows the use of _ (the underscore)
to add italics and bold text and ^ (the circumflex) to add smallcaps.

Usage:  
Import the package with: \usepackage{easyformat}

Now you can do the following in textmode:  
`_italics_, __bold__, ___bolditalic___ and ^smallcaps^.`

The underscore's (_) and circumflex's (^) meaning in
mathmode stay the same.

(See easyformat.pdf for more info.)
