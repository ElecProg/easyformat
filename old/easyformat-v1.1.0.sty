%% NOTE TO FUTURE: Italics correction works because of \maybe@ic.
%                  this macro might disappear in LaTeX3...
%
%                  If the New Font Selection Scheme would change,
%                  stuff WILL break...


%% Administration...
\NeedsTeXFormat{LaTeX2e} % Why no date? We'll leave that to the imports.
\ProvidesPackage{easyformat}
	[2017/04/09 v1.1.0 Adds easier bolds and italics.]


%% Import this handy package
\RequirePackage{ltxcmds}[2011/04/18]


%% Public macros
% Add macros to switch the syntax on or off.
\newcommand*{\setundact}{
	\catcode`\_=\active
}

\newcommand*{\setundsub}{
	\catcode`\_=8
}

% Add some macros which do small parts of what \normalfont does.
\newcommand*{\nrshape}{%
	\fontshape{\shapedefault}%
	\selectfont%
}

\newcommand*{\nrseries}{%
	\fontseries{\seriesdefault}%
	\selectfont%
}


%% CONSTANTS
% Yes I could use \sb but that is a dependency...
\let\EFOR@subscript=_

% To test what style we're currently in.
\def\EFOR@it{it}
\def\EFOR@bf{bx}


%% UTILS
% So we can remove an unnecessary undescore when starting/stopping bold.
\newcommand*{\EFOR@util@removeChar}[1]{}

% Do the first when in mathmode, the second if not.
\newcommand*{\EFOR@util@ifmmode}{%
	\ifmmode
		\expandafter\@firstoftwo
	\else
		\expandafter\@secondoftwo
	\fi
}

% Do the first when equal, the second if not (first or second of
% what comes *after* \EFOR@util@ifx{...}{...} that is).
\newcommand*{\EFOR@util@ifx}[2]{%
	\ifx#1#2\relax
		\expandafter\@firstoftwo
	\else
		\expandafter\@secondoftwo
	\fi
}


%% Formating handling
% Switch italics on or off.
\newcommand*{\EFOR@handle@italic}{%
	\EFOR@util@ifx{\f@shape}{\EFOR@it}
	% \maybe@ic adds italics correction if needed.
	% (might stop working in LaTeX3?)
	{\nrshape\maybe@ic}
	{\itshape}%
}

% Switch boldface on or off.
\newcommand*{\EFOR@handle@bold}{%
	\EFOR@util@ifx{\f@series}{\EFOR@bf}
	{\nrseries}
	{\bfseries}%
}


%% Activate the systems!
% Prepare the syntax in the preamble.
\setundact

% Now finally add the new syntax in the document part.
\AtBeginDocument{
	% Just to be sure
	\setundact
	
	% This is where the magic happens (also differentiates between
	% the text and math mode.)
	% It is \protected because it should work in eg. \section{}
	\protected\def_{\EFOR@util@ifmmode
		{\EFOR@subscript}
		{\ltx@ifnextchar@nospace_
			% \EFOR@util@removeChar removes the second underscore.
			{\EFOR@handle@bold\EFOR@util@removeChar}
			{\EFOR@handle@italic}%
		}%
	}
}

% Cleanup
\AtEndDocument{
	% Why no \def_\undefined?
	% Because if we use this syntax in eg. \section{},
	% the macro should still work in the .aux file...
	\setundsub
}


%% DONE!
\endinput


%% IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
%% Why not \textit/bf\bgroup and \egroup?
%      Well actualy that was the original solution. Hwoever this
%      doesn't differentiate between ending itallics or ending
%      boldface. The current solution does and this makes the syntax
%      more predictable and generally more useful.
